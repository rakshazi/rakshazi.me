description: >
  Simple gui to send SMS via Twilio, using predefined contact list.
  Usage case (example): You are DnD Dungeon Master and you want to notify your party about changes in scheduled event.<br>
  Usage case (real, the reason why that tool has been developed): You are Guild Master and Raid Leader. Your raiders are <b>very</b> forgetful,
  so you need to send them SMS before raid to notify about event.
