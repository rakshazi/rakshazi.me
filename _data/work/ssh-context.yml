description: >
  Bash wrapper around ssh which provides you ability to use contexts (as in kubectl) for SSH.
  Better to describe it with example:
  <ol>
    <li>You are developer involved in multiple projects. Each project has own dev/staging/production servers, git services, ssh keys, etc.</li>
    <li>You don't want to manually enter ssh keys' locations each time (or mix your ssh config file).</li>
    <li>You want to share ssh config of one of the projects.</li>
    <li>It's not usable to do that with standard ssh toolchain</li>
  </ol>
  And here is ssh-context.
  <ol>
    <li>Project = context</li>
    <li>Context = separate ssh config, keys, etc.</li>
    <li>Use full power of isolated ssh config</li>
  </ol>
